Lab Assignment #3

Root Finding Using the Newton-Raphson or Modified Secant Method.

A Python script is developed to nd multiple roots (corresponding to dierent modes) of the
dispersion equation over a range of frequencies. A key aspect of the algorithm is an eective initial
guess strategy based on the asymptotic behavior of the tangent function within the dispersion
equation, allowing for ecient and accurate identication of multiple modes
